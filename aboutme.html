	<h1> About The Socialite</h1>
		<!--<img src="pictures/ink-and-feather-quill-clipart.jpg">-->
		<p>Hello! My name is W. H., but you may call me the Culinary Socialite and I would like to personally welcome you to the site. 
		The site might be very new, however, it has been very long in the making! 
		How long? As far back as when PBS on Sunday afternoon was the go-to for food television. 
		To when Martha Stewart regularly appeared on CBS in the afternoon convincing us to make homemade clay and macaroni and cheese in the same day. 
		And especially when a certain high-level food channel was very low-budget.</p>

		<p>Over the last 10-15 years, there has been a serious food movement.
		No longer being considered a necessary evil, food is being given a more critical eye and cooking has transitioned into a art form.
		Food shows have exploded and transitioned. In the beginning the majority of shows were what are called "stand-and-stir" where a cook/chef would prepare three (3) dishes and engage in one-sided chit chat witht the cameras.
		In contrast, now food television is dominated by competition concepts.
		I'm adverse to this change and would choose an episode 'Everyday Italian" with the overzealous Giada De Laurentiis to "Pro v. Con" any lazy Sunday afternoon.</p>

		<p>The socialite was created to compile as much information about food, cooking, and food TV programming and share the info with as many people as possible. Being a good socialite means being a great hostess. 
		So please feel free to ask questions, share information or thoughts related to the food industry.</p>

	 <h1> About the Site</h1>
		<p style="text-justify">This site is meant to be an all inclusive site. 
		After all, a socialite must also be a great hostess! 
		There is the <em>Articles</em> section that provides up-to-date information about people in the food industry. 
		Besides the usual suspects *Cough cough* Celebrity chefs *cough cough*, we will entertain ourselves with the going-ons of food writers, foodies, health inspections, and up and coming stars.</p> 

<p>Whether you are seeking answers to unanswered questions about chefs/television programming/food oddities or wanting to take a peek at the "The Food Commandments" found under the <em>Recommendations and Referrals</em> tab, there is something for everyone to enjoy!</p>

<p style="text-justify">If you are simply looking for restaurant openings and closings. 
We have plenty of referrals for sites who cover this information in greater depth.</p>
