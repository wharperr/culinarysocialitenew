        Celebrating a Flawed Letter-Grading System in NYC</p>

<p>Take a moment and recall the last restaurant you have eaten. 
Did you notice the grade that food establishment received? 
Whether it was a blue 'A', a green 'B', orange 'C', or 'grade pending' in black font, we must ask "just what do these grades mean?"</p>

<p>During his farewell tour, former mayor Bloomberg was praised for the innovations he made during his tenure. 
One of his noted accomplishments was the implementation of the letter-grade system for restaurant inspections. 
In 2012, over 70% of the restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, and fast-food) and eateries received the coveted 'A'. </p>

<p>To receive this letter, restaurants have to earn 13 or fewer points (like golf, the lower the points, the better the letter grade), during inspections conducted by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). 
To obtain a 'B' requires a score between 14 and 27 points, while the 'C' is the consolation prize to restaurants with scores beyond 28 points. 
And for the points, there are three different types of violations. 
Public health hazards, for example, keeping food items at the correct temperature are seven points, and are considered to pose the greatest risk for customers. 
Unwashed lettuce is an example of a critical violation, which garters five points for each violation. 
General violations such as cookware not being properly cleaned are two points. 
Yet, looking at how and whom scores are distributed to, the 'A' we come to understand from schooling as the highest form of recognition, is not always pristine.</p>

<p>First, restaurants are given anywhere from two three attempts to earn the 'A'. 
No restaurant should be given three attempts to serve food prepared in sanitary conditions. 
If a restaurant fails to earn the top letter during the initial inspection, their score is classified as 'ungraded', and a health inspector is expected to make a "surprise" visit the following month. 
At the conclusion of the second inspection, the restaurant if still not given an 'A' has a choice to display the resulting grade or a 'Grade Pending', contesting their case in the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearing Health. 
A few years ago, a Chipotle Mexican Grill in my neighborhood earned a 'C', with a total of 49 violation points. 
Oddly, the line always remained at the door (any Chipotle fan will appreciate the significance of this statement). 
Meanwhile, the restaurant kept the grade for four months before finally earning the 'A'. 
Referencing the grade posted in a restaurant does not tell a customer any of these sordid details. </p>

<p>Taking the grades at face value, a fair amount of eateries manage to earn the blue letter after the initial or subsequent inspections. 
Unfortunately, their posted grade displayed proudly in their establishments' window, looks the same as the one in that Chipotle. 
Put this occurrence in a classroom context. 
One student attends every lecture, takes notes, complete assignments and readings. 
The other student hardly attends class, does not even touch the assigned readings, and bums notes off friends and classmates to piece together assignments. 
At the end of the semester, both students earn the 'A'. 
Many patrons use the blue letter as a signal that eating in that particular place will pose minimal risk.</p>	

<p>Another drawback to the letter-grading system lies with the leeway restaurants to buy away their problems. 
Ideally, after each inspection an eating establishment should take a critical eye over the violations and work on improving them both for their patrons health and safety and the next inspection by the DOHMH. 
Instead, many restaurants choose to pay the fines and allow the issues to persists; restaurants take a lost by paying fines to avoid more costly alternatives such as fixing their plumbing system or receiving a lower grade. 
In this way, the grading system does not as hoped encourage food establishments to maintain hygienic conditions in food preparation/handling. 
Rather, they are taught that success only requires bare minimum effort. </p>	

<p>While the Bloomberg administration reported an estimated 72% of restaurants received an 'A', almost 90 percent of restaurant owners despise the letter-grading system. 
We see this in the endless complaints from chefs and restaurant owners. 
From Mario Batali's restaurants is Elizabeth Meltz, overseer of food safety. 
Her biggest criticism was that some health inspectors did not understand the "complexity" of many of the dishes offered, such as kimchi, which is fermented cabbage and assorted vegetables. 
Fermented, for non-foodies is a glorified way of saying left in a jar for a very long time. </p>	

<p>While the system has flaws and loopholes, it is still effective in decreasing reported food illnesses, with the salmonella cases at a 20-year low, according to the DOHMH. 
Luckily, there is now an app called ABCEats, available to iPhone and Android users to obtain a readily accessible breakdown of any restaurant in the five boroughs. 
The app can be used to look up the health inspection results of a beloved eating establishment, or investigate a potential place to dine. 
However, former mayor Bloomberg or DOHMH did not do enough to promote the app (and from the countless anti-soda ads on subways and media campaign, we know the city is quite capable).</p>

<p>The biggest criticism of the letter-grade system is that once the grades are posted, patrons are still left with the burden to figure out just how clean that 'A' is. </p>
