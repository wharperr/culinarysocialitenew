    <p>A culinary education (whether an institute or a center) is a formal education setting designed for chefs of various skill-sets. 
    Michael Ruhlman's book The Making of a Chef: Mastering Heat at the Culinary Institute of America, is heralded in the culinary world as "a great introduction to the world of culinary education."
    But is a culinary eduation whooly necessary?</p>
    
    <p>There are many instances of a chef not having a culinary arts degree and yet have successful careers.
    Gordon Ramsey. Tom Colicchio. Ina Garten. Thomas Keller. Jamie Oliver. 
    Yes I dropped names, but the fact that many of these names are households names proves the point.
    So if not having a degree in culinary arts leads to success, then the sensible conclusion would be that a culinary arts education increases chances for success in the restaurant industry.</p>
    
    <p>Right?</p>
    
    <p> Not necessarily. 
    The price tag for an Associate's degree is $35,000-$60,000 and approximately $100,000 for a Bachelor's degree. 
    Yet, the majority of entry-level positions have a starting pay of $10/hr. Not to mention the loans that would often be necessary for such a venture.</p>
    
    <p>In the culinary world, the issue remains a debate between chefs. 
    Some proudly advocate for formal education in the culinary arts, while others cry foul over the debt/wage ratio and the competitive nature of the field.
    We can rehash theory and quote the statistics from both sides all day. Without seeing it from the inside, how coud you ever be sure?</p>
    
    <p>So I decide to visit a culinary school in NYC to settle the debate once and for all.</p>
    
    <p>I realized very early on that being truthful with the culinary school's staff and barging in with my probing questions would not be fruitful.
    So I pretended to be a prospective culinary arts student.
    I felt slight deception in my role, however, I knew I would not get the kind of access I needed otherwise in such a short time and with minimal costs (a Metrocard is all). 
    Besides I promised nothing during my visit. 
    I stated in the beginning that I was only interested in learning more about the school.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 21px"><em>The Visit</em></p>
    
    <p>My initial contact with the school was via email, which never received a response. 
    Made a second attempt via phone with the Office of Admissions, who transferred my call to a man named *David*. 
    After small talk and a brief conversation about the school, I was able to make an appointment to tour the school.</p>
    
    <p>At the time of the appointment,I was instructed by hostess to walk through the restaurant, through the corridor towards the elevators, to the admissions office and instructed to wait. 
    I took some flyers and looked at the cookbooks placed on a side table by a window.
    My brief research told me the school was privately owned. Duly noted.</p>
    
    <p>After a few moments, David came out and introduced himself before leading me into a conference room. 
    Martin would became my guide for the day; he led us to conference room with a large projector screen.
    The appointment starts with him asking about my interest in the culinary field. 
    There was some small talk about his daughter wanting to go to college and his knowing Lady Gaga when she was Stephanie (*cough* name dropping *cough*).
    Then he showed a PowerPoint presentation about the school. 
    I was able to point out many of the faces as recognizable to me. 
    Martin paused the presentation and asked me about my experience cooking, which I said was "okay". I was also asked what interested me about food, to which I replied about food's ability to break cultural barriers and its universal appeal - flavors being a universal language. 
    He nodded, agreeing. He told me about the 12:1 student to faculty ratio. Then we go on a tour of the school, which I realize is bigger inside than its outer appearance. We learned about some of the different areas:</p>
    <ul style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000"; >
        <li style="list-style-type: none">Basic Techniques</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none">Pastry</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none">Food Costs/Food Waste</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none">Wine Pairings + More Technique</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none">Mass Production & Consistent Execution</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none">Working the School Restaurant</li>
    </ul>
<p>I also learned abut some of the other programs, which I expressed less interest in , to which he replied, "Well, you're gonna learn it."
We walked past classrooms (kitchens) on each level, a class baking bread was just dismissed. 
My guide gave me a free baguette from the class assignment. The baugette was approximately 2.5 feet, warm, fresh, and quite delicious! Wait. Was this  Bribe?
Probably, but my mouth was full of warm bread to notice. 
A student approached me while my guide was sneaking more bread and asked me nodding to my baguette "Isn't David the best?" I nodded, although the would be swell if he could find some butter...
Afterwards, I was taken to career services, where a Career Counselor explained that I was being afforded a unique opportunity of lifetime advisement on my career path. 
Bob, the career advisor said that getting a job in the restaurant industry is easy, however, the purpose of culinary school is to find a career path that suited my interest and goals, etc.
After the stop in career services, we continued the tour around the school. David was a great person to serve as a guide because everyone (workers, faculty, staff, and students) seemed to know him and greeted him.
David interacted with all of the students during the tour. 
Some were responsive, others were less forthcoming, and some even resisted all attempts at conversation.
So friendly, in fact, that when I felt the students staring at me, I feeling like Emma Page's character in the movie "Inception" when she was in Leonardo DiCaprio's dream and his subconscious her presence and starting attacking her...never mind, back to the visit.</p>

<p>David said that the purpose of the school was dedicated to producing well-minded students versed in savory and pastry.
Although I do possess knowledge of the culinary world and its mechanics, my knowledge wasn't enough to ease the level of discomfort I felt in being there as an outsider.
Initially, I thought that I was going to get information about the culture of culinary schools, but I see that given the context of my visit, and my guide, that I was really learning first-hand about the process of recruiting people into the culinary school.
My food knowledge afforded me some credibility to the purpose of my visit and I wasnâ€™t expected to be able to put "face to name" for the notable/famous chefs or understand the techniques, which to an extent makes sense since some people who enter the field have no prior experience. 
In fact, David and I got into a dispute over who won Season 1 of "Top Chef" [of course being a self-proclaimed superfan, I won with no help from Google]. 
I was warned that culinary students get cut, burned, and gain weight, especially if not careful. 
We were touring the restaurant that is staff by students when Alan Richman (a notable food critic) and his party were seated. 
The energy changed into nervousness of some of the dining room staff (and I am ashamed to say David as well).</p>

<p>At the end of the tour, I was asked to apply for the school and get an answer on the spot. I begged off stating I needed to think thing over.
Overall, I felt that I was truly a prospective student interested in a culinary education, I would have been sold. 
But, armed with previous research student debt in the field, the intel from the non-verbal cues: the car-salesman approach, the guarantee of a job ost-graduation, the mumbling when I mentioned the word FAFSA, and the unfriendliness of some of the students painted a different less pretty picture.</p>

<p>A culinary education might not be for me, but is also not for everyone.</p>
